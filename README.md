# AMWAPI - Angular, MongoDB, Web API

## Introduction

Basic Visual Studio template that couples ASP.Net Web API, but with AngularJS and Grunt.


* I like C#
* I love AngularJS
* I love open source workflows, e.g. Grunt
* I love bower
* I don't like bundle config.

## Getting started

I haven't created a suitable template installation process yet, so the easiest thing to do is either clone, or download the .zip.

Open the solution, and build and run it.  Then simply export the template.

## I've installed the template, now what?

There are a few things you'll need to do, but it shouldn't take too long.

* Install Node, without it, you can't go any further
* Install Bower
* npm install - this installs the dev dependencies, namely grunt
* bower install - this installs the client-side dependencies
* Install and run MongoDB
* In web.config, set the databaseUrl value to whatever you're database URL is.
* Set your choice of web server (IIS Local or IIS Express)
* Set the virtual directory
* Run grunt
* Run the project
